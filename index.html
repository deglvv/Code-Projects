        <p>imagine a world without sex, might be crazy, right? As George Fieldsith says,
            that wouldnt be a problem because sex doesnt exist, otherwise someone should test it to him.
            At the moment, people use to have sex once per two weeks. Old people think this is
            because of the world famous actual genre called reggaeton, that as they say, it
            promotes to normalize sex, alcohol, drugs and feeling good to have emotional
            irresponsability.</p>

                    <p> ALERT, THIS AINT AN EMERGENCY!!! Men around the world are scared to meeting girls with this proffile,
                        no one can know where did they come from, but after a quest, 80% of men says that this type of girls
                        would destroy your life in days. About this, the World's Health Organization says that men should don't
                        be frightened because is a canon event to pass from this once on their lifes. Also, is not sure that
                        this depends on how them look, but the way they have lived with priviledge.

<!-- CSS
style:
    1: worst way (too much code)
        <body>
            <element style = "color: col;"> </element>
        </body>
    2: not best way (code per file)
        <head>
            <style>
                element {
                    color: col;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
    3: better way
        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
